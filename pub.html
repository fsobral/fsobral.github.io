        The Low Order-Value Optimization (LOVO) problem involves minimizing the minimum among a finite number of function values within a feasible set. LOVO has several
        practical applications such as robust parameter estimation, protein alignment, portfolio optimization, among others. In this work, we are interested in the constrained
        nonlinear optimization LOVO problem of minimizing the minimum between a finite number of function values subject to a nonempty closed convex set where each function is
        a black-box and continuously differentiable, but the derivatives are not available. We develop the first derivative-free trust-region algorithm for constrained LOVO 
        problems with convergence to weakly critical points. Under suitable conditions, we establish the global convergence of the algorithm and also its worst-case iteration 
        complexity analysis. An initial open-source implementation using only linear interpolation models is developed. Extensive numerical experiments and comparison with 
        existing alternatives show the properties and the efficiency of the proposed approach when solving LOVO problems.

        Quasi-Newton methods are well known techniques for large-scale
        numerical optimization. They use an approximation of the
        Hessian in optimization problems or the Jacobian in system of
        nonlinear equations. In the Interior Point context,
        quasi-Newton algorithms compute low-rank updates of the matrix
        associated with the Newton systems, instead of computing it
        from scratch at every iteration. In this work, we show that a
        simplified quasi-Newton primal-dual interior point algorithm
        for linear programming enjoys polynomial worst-case iteration
        complexity. Feasible and infeasible cases of the algorithm are
        considered and the most common neighborhoods of the central
        path are analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
        first attempt to deliver polynomial worst-case iteration
        complexity bounds for these methods. Unsurprisingly, the
        worst-case complexity results obtained when quasi-Newton
        directions are used are worse than their counterparts when
        Newton directions are employed. However, quasi-Newton updates
        are very attractive for large-scale optimization problems
        where the cost of factorizing the matrices is much higher than
        the cost of solving linear systems.

        Complexity analysis has become an important tool in the
        convergence analysis of optimization algorithms. For
        derivative-free optimization algorithms, it is not
        different. Interestingly, several constants that appear when
        developing complexity results hide the dimensions of the
        problem. This work organizes several results in literature
        about bounds that appear in derivative-free trust-region
        algorithms based on linear and quadratic models. All the
        constants are given explicitly by the quality of the sample
        set, dimension of the problem and number of sample points. We
        extend some results to allow "inexact" interpolation sets. We
        also provide a clearer proof than those already existing in
        literature for the underdetermined case.

        In this paper, we present the online tool
        salaplanejada.unifesp.br developed to assist the layout
        planning of classrooms considering the social distance in the
        context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We address both the
        allocation problem in rooms where seats are fixed as well as
        the problem in rooms where seats can be moved freely. For the
        first case, we use two integer optimization models and
        discussed some curiosities about the solutions found. For the
        case of mobile seats, we handle the problem with circle
        packing techniques using continuous non-linear
        optimization. For these problems we propose a new model and
        algorithms to solve the problem, similar to other packing
        problems in the literature. In addition, we propose a
        heuristic that provides not only a good starting point for the
        optimization procedure but also a configuration ensuring the
        students positions in lines, that may be of interest to the
        user. Some computational results are presented to illustrate
        the numerical behavior of the algorithms and models.

        The development of Pickering emulsions as ecologically correct
        stabilized with bio-based material by substituting synthetic
        petroleum-derived tensoactives assumed a very attractive
        level, representing the current guideline of the global market
        for homecare industry, food and beverage applications. In this
        wor, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), a hierarchically advanced
        biomaterial, were produced to stabilize innovative emulsions
        formulated with western soapberry Sapindus saponaria L. oil
        (SO). Besides, green surfactants (triterpene saponins
        extracted from S. saponaria L. pericarp; SAP) were also
        investigated to stabilize the oil/water interface. The
        synergistic combination between cellulose nanowhiskers and the
        bioactive glycosides has never been reported in the
        literature. Dynamic interfacial tensions of SAP and SO were
        firstly investigated, and their capacity to form a plastic
        membrane at oil/water interface was revealed. Response surface
        methodology (RSM) was employed to study the influence of the
        binary systems (CNC:SAP) on the stability of emulsified
        systems, such as size and zeta potential. In addition, a new
        calculation was proposed to determine the coverage of the oil
        droplets formed by the mixture of cellulose crystallites and
        natural surfactants. The optimal nanoemulsion composition was
        determined to be 60 w/w (%) of water, 23.905 w/w % of SO, 5
        w/w % of CNC and 8.095 w/w% of SAP to produce of smallest
        droplet (165.1 nm) combined with higher zeta potential module
        (-46.7 mV). Results highlight the potential of Sapindus
        saponins and cellulose nanowhiskers for efficient producing
        label-friendly nanoemulsions applicable for drug,
        cosmeceutical or edible delivery systems

          The robust adjustment of nonlinear models to data is considered in
          this paper. When data comes from real experiments, it is possible that
          measurement errors cause the appearance of discrepant values, which
          should be ignored when adjusting models to them. This work presents a
          Lower Order-value Optimization (LOVO) version of the
          Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which is well suited to deal with
          outliers in fitting problems. A general algorithm is presented and
          convergence to stationary points is demonstrated. Numerical results
          show that the algorithm is successfully able to detect and ignore
          outliers without too many specific parameters. Parallel and
          distributed executions of the algorithm are also possible, allowing
          for the use of larger datasets. Comparison against publicly available
          robust algorithms shows that the present approach is able to find
          better adjustments in well known statistical models.

          Interior Point Methods (IPM) rely on the Newton method for solving systems of nonlinear equations. Solving the linear systems which arise from this approach is the most computationally expensive task of an interior point iteration. If, due to problem&apos;s inner structure, there are special techniques for efficiently solving linear systems, IPMs enjoy fast convergence and are able to solve large scale optimization problems. It is tempting to try to replace the Newton method by quasi-Newton methods. Quasi-Newton approaches to IPMs either are built to approximate the Lagrangian function for nonlinear programming problems or provide an inexpensive preconditioner. In this work we study the impact of using quasi-Newton methods applied directly to the nonlinear system of equations for general quadratic programming problems. The cost of each iteration can be compared to the cost of computing correctors in a usual interior point iteration. Numerical experiments show that the new approach is able to reduce the overall number of matrix factorizations and is suitable for a matrix-free implementation. <BR> <BR> *The Technical Report is a pre-print of an article

        The discovery and characterization of driving behavior profiles can be useful to support the optimization of processes for insurance companies or fleet managers. The evolution of ubiquitous computing and data analysis techniques have made such tasks possible. In this paper, we present a study on the analysis of driving behavior through clustering algorithms on a real-world dataset. We applied the k-Means++ and Spectral Clustering algorithms that came up with results that showed: the existence of less and more aggressive behavior profiles; potential to discover more profiles since preliminary quantitative evaluation indicated good quality in clustering with four profiles.

        In this work we present an algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems that does not make explicit use of the objective function derivatives. The algorithm mixes an inexact restoration framework with filter techniques, where the forbidden regions can be given by the flat or slanting filter rule. Each iteration is decomposed in two independent phases: a feasibility phase which reduces an infeasibility measure without evaluations of the objective function, and an optimality phase which reduces the objective function value. As the derivatives of the objective function are not available, the optimality step is computed by derivative-free trust-region internal iterations. Any technique to construct the trust-region models can be used since the gradient of the model is a reasonable approximation of the gradient of the objective function at the current point. Assuming this and classical assumptions, we prove that the full steps are efficient in the sense that near a feasible nonstationary point, the decrease in the objective function is relatively large, ensuring the global convergence results of the algorithm. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

        A new method is introduced for solving constrained optimization problems in which the derivatives of the constraints are available but the derivatives of the objective function are not. The method is based on the Inexact Restoration framework, by means of which each iteration is divided in two phases. In the first phase one considers only the constraints, in order to improve feasibility. In the second phase one minimizes a suitable objective function subject to a linear approximation of the constraints. The second phase must be solved using derivative-free methods. An algorithm introduced recently by Kolda, Lewis, and Torczon for linearly constrained derivative-free optimization is employed for this purpose. Under usual assumptions, convergence to stationary points is proved. A computer implementation is described and numerical experiments are presented.

        Many derivative-free methods for constrained problems are not efficient for minimizing functions on \"thin\" domains. Other algorithms, like those based on Augmented Lagrangians, deal with thin constraints using penalty-like strategies. When the constraints are computationally inexpensive but highly nonlinear, these methods spend many potentially expensive objective function evaluations motivated by the difficulties of improving feasibility. An algorithm that handles efficiently this case is proposed in this paper. The main iteration is split into two steps: restoration and minimization. In the restoration step the aim is to decrease infeasibility without evaluating the objective function. In the minimization step the objective function <I>f</I> is minimized on a relaxed feasible set. A global minimization result will be proved and computational experiments showing the advantages of this approach will be presented.

        Given a fixed set of identical or different-sized circular items, the problem we deal with consists on finding the smallest object within which the items can be packed. Circular, triangular, squared, rectangular and also strip objects are considered. Moreover, 2D and 3D problems are treated. Twice-differentiable models for all these problems are presented. A strategy to reduce the complexity of evaluating the models is employed and, as a consequence, instances with a large number of items can be considered. Numerical experiments show the flexibility and reliability of the new unified approach.

        Derivative-free optimization problems arise from models whose derivatives of some functions are not available. This information is unavailable due to extremely complex and black-box functions, originated from simulation procedures, or even to user inability. Following the growth in the number of applications, the number of derivative-free algorithms has increased in the last years. However, few algorithms are able to handle thin feasible domains efficiently, for example, in the presence of equality nonlinear constraints. In the present work, we describe the theory and implementation of two algorithms capable of dealing with thin-constrained derivative-free problems. Their definition considers that the objective function evaluation is the most expensive part of the problem. Based on this principle, the process of solving a problem is split into two phases. In the restoration phase, we try to improve the feasibility without evaluating the objective function. In the minimization phase, the aim is to decrease the objective function value by using well-established algorithms in order to solve derivative-free problems with simple constraints. The first algorithm uses Inexact Restoration ideas together with a decreasing infeasibility tolerance. Under the usual hypotheses of direct search methods, we show global minimization results. The second algorithm extends to the derivative-free case all the theoretical results obtained in a recent line-search Inexact Restoration algorithm. In this approach, only the derivatives of the objective function are not available. We perform numerical experiments to show the advantages of each algorithm, in particular when comparing with penalty-like algorithms.

        In problems of hierarchical nature, the choices made by the most influential level - the so-called leader - affect the behavior of the lower levels. For each one of the leader&#039;s decisions there is a response from the lower levels, which maximizes the value of their respective objectives. These optimal choices, in return, may have influence in the results achieved by the leader, which also wants to make the optimal choices. In mathematical programming, this kind of problem is described as a multilevel programming problem. The present work considers a specific kind of multilevel problem: the bilevel mathematical problem. We study a resolution technique which consists in replacing the lower level problem by its necessary first order conditions, which can be formulated in various ways, as complementarity constraints occur and are modified. The new reformulated problem is a nonlinear programming problem which can be solved by classical optimization methods. Using first and second order optimality conditions, we show the relations between the original bilevel problem and the reformulated problem. We apply the described technique to solve a set of bilevel problems taken from the literature, analyse their behavior and discuss strategies to prevent undesirable difficulties that may arise.
